		<p>I learned some blacksmithing in the MIT Merton C. Flemings Materials Processing Lab. I started out with a test piece to practice techniques such as tapering, twisting, bending, and punching holes. I then applied that to the project of my choice, in this case, a fancy looking door knocker. It took four hours over the course of two days, and it was quite a workout!</p>
