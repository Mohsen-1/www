		<p>I designed the shirt for Simmons Hall undergraduate dormitory for REX (Residence Exploration) 2015, in which new MIT freshman explore all the dorms on campus, and come to events held by the dorms.</p>
		<p>That year our theme was Jurassic Park, and our mascot, the rubber duck, must make it's way onto the shirt somehow. This was the result. It came in four colors.</p>
